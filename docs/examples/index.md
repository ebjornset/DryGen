# Examples
The  menu on the left lists the dry-gen examples. Each of these pages will give you information on how to use the various dry-gen features. 

> [!NOTE]
> The resulting representations in the examples are all generated running dry-gen. 
> We've only used commandline options, since that makes it easier to keep the source representation together. 
> You migth be better off using options files (by specifying the option `-â€“options-file`) instead of these long command lines."
