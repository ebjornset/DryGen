- New options `--include-assemblynames` and `--exclude-assemblynames` for the verb [mermaid-c4component-diagram-from-dotnet-deps-json](/verbs/mermaid-c4component-diagram-from-dotnet-deps-json.html).
- Removed all dependencies on external assemblies when generating Mermaid diagrams from C# code, to prevent version clashes that could happen if the user code is referencing other versions of any of these assemblies.
- Loads user assemblies in a separate AssemblyLoadContext when generating Mermaid diagrams from C# code, to prevent a possible version clash on the Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives assembly.
- Generate entity names for generic types with - instead of \` in Mermaid ER diagrams, since \` is illegal in the Mermaid ER syntax

Have fun!
