Fixes for the following issues in Mermaid class diagrams:

1. Relationships between generic classes did not use the proper Mermaid class diagram generic syntax, so some diagrams would fail to render.
2. Syntetic methods generated by the C# compiler for some special syntax would be exposed as private methods in the diagrams.
3. Relationships using List and Collection ended up as properties the diagrams.

Have fun!
