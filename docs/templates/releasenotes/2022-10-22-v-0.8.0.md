- Extension methods are now promoted to instance methods on the extended classes in Mermaid class diagrams. Extension methods are still handled as static methods in the extension class if the extended class is not a class in the diagram. Extension classes where all extension methods are promoted are removed from the diagram. This will hopefully produce class diagrams that closely matches the logical code.

Have fun!
