## Improvements in this version
- Added support for .Net 9
### Prerelease 3 (2024-11-10)
- Fixed an issue where the lookup of the Asp.Net Core shared folder failed if the version number for .Net and Asp.Net Core was not exactly the same.
  - E.g. for .Net 9 RC 2 where the Asp.Net Core version number was 9.0.0-rc.2.24474.3, but the .Net version number was 9.0.0-rc.2.24473.5
### Prerelease 2 (2024-11-03)
- Added support for .Net 9 RC 2
- Added support for generating many to many associations in `mermaid-class-diagram-from-csharp`.
- Added support for generating many to many relations in `mermaid-er-diagram-from-csharp`.
- Added support for `include-exception-stacktrace` in `verbs-from-options-file`.
### Prerelease 1 (2024-10-29)
- Fixed an issue where  `mermaid-er-diagram-from-efcore` would fail when an input assebly referenced Asp.Net Core. 
   - Ie the .csproj file contained `<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">` or `<FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App|All"/>` or referenced such an assembly.
- Added support for generating many to many relations in `mermaid-er-diagram-from-efcore`.
- Switched to [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) for generating  the documentation. 
   - docfx uses .Net, so Ruby is no longer needed in the development toolchain

Have fun!
