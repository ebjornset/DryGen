**The branch `gh-pages` is used to publish the dry-gen docs using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).** 

**The content is generated with [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) during release.**

**You should never, ever edit anything here manually, as your changes will be wiped by the next release!**
