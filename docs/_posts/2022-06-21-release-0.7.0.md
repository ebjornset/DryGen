### In this version
1. Deprected the options `--exclude-all-attributes` and `--exclude-foreignkey-attributes` in favor of `--attribute-type-exclusion`.
2. Deprected the option `--exclude-all-relationships` in favor of `--relationship-type-exclusion`. 

**NB! These deprected options will be removed in the next major release (1.0)** 

The relase also includes some examples of the usage of the different Mermaid diagram options.

Have fun!
