title: V 0.5.0 is released
subtitle: New verb 'options-from-commandline' and documentation for each verb.
summary: |-
    New verb 'options-from-commandline' and documentation for each verb (generated from the help text ;-) )
---
### In this version
1. Support for the new verb 'options-from-commandline', which makes it easy to get a skeleton of a options file for a verb from its options. Run `dry-gen options-from-commandline --help' for details on usage.
1. We now have documentation for each verb dry-gen supports. These pages are generated from the existing help texts and the new 'options-from-commandline' verb. So every time we improves the help text we also improves the documentations. Thats pretty DRY, or ;-)

Have fun!
