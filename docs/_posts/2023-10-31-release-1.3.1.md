  Fix Mermaid "Syntax error in text" when a class diagram contains empty classes

### In this version

#### Mermaid class diagrams

Generate "emtpy" classes (without attributes or methods) without {}, e.g. like

```
classdiagram
  class Foo
```

instead of

```
classdiagram
  class Foo {
  }
```

since the last syntax causes some versions of Mermaid to report "Syntax error in text"

Have fun!
