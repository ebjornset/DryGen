### In this version

- ..Net templates for easy integration of dry-gen into the development process using [MSBuild targets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-targets){:target="\_blank"}, see [Getting strarted](/#developmentprocessintegration)
  - Project template for generating Mermaid diagrams from C# code
  - Project template for generating C# code and Mermaid diagrams from json schemas
- Added the option `--include-exception-stacktrace` to help debug issues with `dry-gen` it self. NB! This option is only shown if an exception is trown during a `dry-gen` run.
- Fixed issue where dry-gen would fail if passed an empty options file (or an options file with only blank lines or comments)

Have fun!
