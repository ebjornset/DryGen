### In this version

- .Net Core 3.1 is longer supported, since its no longer supported by Microsoft.
- Removed the deprecated options for the [mermaid-er-diagram-from-csharp](/verbs/mermaid-er-diagram-from-csharp/) and [mermaid-er-diagram-from-efcore](/verbs/mermaid-er-diagram-from-efcore/) verbs; `exclude-all-attributes`, `exclude-foreignkey-attributes` and `exclude-all-relationships`. You should upgrade to using the `attribute-type-exclusion` and `relationship-type-exclusion` options instead.
- The [mermaid-er-diagram-from-efcore](/verbs/mermaid-er-diagram-from-efcore/) verb no longer depends on a spesific version of Entity Framework Core being present. The Ef Core assemblies and types are now loaded by reflection, so any version compatible with your .Net version should work.

Have fun!
