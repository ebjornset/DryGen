### In this version

- .Net template XXXX
- Added the option `--include-exception-stacktrace` to help debug issues with `dry-gen` it self. NB! This option is only shown if an exception is trown during a `dry-gen` run.
- Fixed issue where dry-gen would fail if passed an empty options file (or an options file with only blank lines or comments)

Have fun!
