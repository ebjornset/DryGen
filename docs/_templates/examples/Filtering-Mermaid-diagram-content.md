### About these examples
These examples show how you can control C# types that will be included in your Mermaid diagrams. Here we will only focus on the Class diagrams, but the filtering capabilities are the same for ER diagrams, so you can use the same filters for your ER diagrams.

In the following examples we exclude most of the diagram content details, to make it easier to follow the examples. [The Mermaid Class diagram details examples](../mermaid-class-diagram-details/) digs into more details on how to control the content details in your Mermaid Class diagrams and [the Mermaid ER diagram details examples](../mermaid-er-diagram-details/) does the same for Mermaid Er diagrams.

### No filtering
Most C# codebases will soon contain a lot of types, so a class diagram without any filters can be far to detailed to be of any practical use.
#### The commandline
`.!.!.replace-token-for-mermaid-diagram-filter-example-no-filtering-commandline.!.!.`
#### The resulting Mermaid diagram
```mermaid
.!.!.replace-token-for-mermaid-diagram-filter-example-no-filtering.!.!.
```
### Filtering with `--tree-shaking-roots`
Use `--tree-shakong-roots` if you want a diagram with all C# types that has a relationship with one or more type(s). 

In this example we show all the dry-gen types related to the interface `ITypeFilter`. 
#### The commandline
`.!.!.replace-token-for-mermaid-diagram-filter-example-tree-shaking-roots-commandline.!.!.`
#### The resulting Mermaid diagram
{% include notification.html status="is-dark" message="This diagram contains more or less all the C# types implemnting the filtering capabilities we look at in these examples."%}
```mermaid
.!.!.replace-token-for-mermaid-diagram-filter-example-tree-shaking-roots.!.!.
```

### Filtering with `--include-namespaces`
Use `--include-namespaces` if you want a diagram with all C# types in one or more of your namespaces. 

In this example we show all the dry-gen types in the namespace `DryGen.MermaidFromCSharp.ClassDiagram`. 
#### The commandline
`.!.!.replace-token-for-mermaid-diagram-filter-example-include-namespaces-commandline.!.!.`
#### The resulting Mermaid diagram
{% include notification.html status="is-dark" message="This diagram contains more or less all the C# types implemnting the capabilities to generate Mermaid Class diagrams."%}
```mermaid
.!.!.replace-token-for-mermaid-diagram-filter-example-include-namespaces.!.!.
```
