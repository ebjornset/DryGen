The dry-gen tool is developed as an open source software project hosted on [Github](https://github.com/ebjornset/DryGen){:target="\_blank"} under the [MIT licence](https://github.com/ebjornset/DryGen/blob/main/LICENSE.md){:target="\_blank"}

### Inspiration

Beside the ["don't repeat yourself" (DRY) prinsiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself){:target="\_blank"}, formulated in the book [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer){:target="\_blank"}, [Mermaid (.js)](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/){:target="\_blank"} is the main inspiration for dry-gen. Their documentation formats are so terse and simple that I was able to get my first diagram up and running in a few minutes by just typing plain text in my editor! Knowing a bit about C# reflection I realized that generating Mermaid diagrams from C# assemblies would be a managable task, and thus dry-gen was borned.

### Development tools

As an open source tool **"we're standing on the shoulder of giants"**, and we heavily rely on the hard work of others volunteers. Drygen would probably never have seen the light of day without these other execellent tools:

- The main developement tool is [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/){:target="\_blank"}, a free, cross-platform, and open source developer platform.
- Github is used for our [code repository](https://github.com/ebjornset/DryGen){:target="\_blank"}, [issue tracker](https://github.com/ebjornset/DryGen/issues){:target="\_blank"}, [deployment tool](https://github.com/ebjornset/DryGen/actions){:target="\_blank"} and [documetation site](https://docs.drygen.dev/){:target="\_blank"}
- We use [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/){:target="\_blank"} and their SAAS offering [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=ebjornset_DryGen){:target="\_blank"} (free for open source projects) as our static code analysis tool.
- We use [Mend bolt](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/bolt/){:target="\_blank"} (free for open source projects) as our security alerts and compliance tool.
- The [documentation site](https://docs.drygen.dev/){:target="\_blank"} is generated at deploy time using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="\_blank"} engine.
- As a commandline tool, we rely heavily on the [Command Line Parser Library](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline){:target="\_blank"}.
- [YamlDotNet](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet){:target="\_blank"} is used to implement the `--options-file` option.
- The verb `csharp-from-json-schema` is using [NJsonSchema](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NJsonSchema){:target="\_blank"} as the internal engine doing all the hard work.
- We use [Nuke](https://nuke.build/){:target="\_blank"} as our build tool, and to generate our [Github actions](https://github.com/ebjornset/DryGen/actions){:target="\_blank"}.
- We use [xunit.net](https://xunit.net/){:target="\_blank"} as our test running framework
- [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/){:target="\_blank"} is used to assert the code is doing what we expects.
- All out tests are written as [Behavioral specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development#Behavioral_specifications){:target="\_blank"} using [Specflow](https://specflow.org){:target="\_blank"}.
  - Here is the [Integration test specifications](specs/drygen-itests.html){:target="\_blank"} generated by [SpecFlow+ LivingDoc](https://specflow.org/tools/living-doc/){:target="\_blank"}.
  - And here is the [Unit test specifications](specs/drygen-utests.html){:target="\_blank"}, also generated by [SpecFlow+ LivingDoc](https://specflow.org/tools/living-doc/){:target="\_blank"}.
