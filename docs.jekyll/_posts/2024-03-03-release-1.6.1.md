### In this version
- Added support for generating `enum` properties in `mermaid-er-diagram-from-csharp` and `mermaid-er-diagram-from-efcore`. Each enum type used as a property in a type is generated as its own entity with the enum values as attributes. Enum properties are generated as `int` attributes in the entity and as a relationship from the entity to the enum entity.
- Added support for generating `byte[]` properties as `Blob` attributes in `mermaid-class-diagram-from-csharp`.
- Added support for generating `byte[]` properties as `blob` attributes in `mermaid-er-diagram-from-csharp` and `mermaid-er-diagram-from-efcore`.
- Added support for title in mermaid class diagrams and er diagrams.
- Fixed stack overflow exception that happended when running `mermaid-class-diagram-from-csharp` agains a generic type with a where constraint referencing the declaring type it self.

Have fun!
